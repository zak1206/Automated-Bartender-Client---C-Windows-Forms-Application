# Automated-Bartender-Client---C#SWindows-Forms-Application
Client application written in C# to communicate with an Arduino to control several peristaltic pumps attached to a mini-fridge. Each pump has an assigned liquid it can dispense and once each pump has been assigned to a liquid, you can create drink recipes where the Arduino can activate each pump for the required amount of time.
